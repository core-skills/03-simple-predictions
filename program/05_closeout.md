# Takeaways & Reflection

Today we've:

* covered how linear regression fits into the general framework of machine learning.
* covered the importance of plotting data in the context of linear regression.
* covered the statistical assumptions of linear regression and can apply this knowledge critically to datasets.
* covered the meaning and limitations of coefficient of determination (R^2) in models.
* covered how linear regression is applicable in broad situations that at first glance do not appear linear, through application of transforms and through template fitting.
* covered alternatives to least-squares in linear regression, and that these “robust” methods can be applicable to problems that would otherwise lead to non-meaningful regressions.
* been introduced to classifiers, confusion matrices and precision and recall.
* had an overview of the concepts of validation, and of training, validation and test datasets.
