## Aims

1. Perform statistical model building.
2. Conduct regression.
3. Generate simple predictions - regression.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand regression as the basis for prediction.
2. Understand how outliers and noisy data affect results.
3. Understand the impact of missing data and recall practical solutions to work with incomplete data sets.
4. Understand how to choose between basic statistical models and evaluate their effectiveness (e.g. linear vs polynomial).
5. Have an understanding of hierarchical models as a means of modelling connections between datasets or processes.
